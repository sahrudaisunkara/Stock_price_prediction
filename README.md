📊 Stock Market Prediction System using LSTM & Streamlit

This project is a stock market prediction system that uses deep learning (LSTM) along with classical technical indicators to predict the next trading session’s High and Low prices for multiple stocks.
The system integrates live market data from Yahoo Finance and presents predictions through an interactive Streamlit web application.

Each stock is modeled independently using a dedicated LSTM network and stock-specific normalization parameters to ensure accurate price scaling. Alongside AI-based predictions, Moving Average (MA20 & MA50) crossover analysis is used to provide an interpretable trend direction (Bullish/Bearish) for comparison.
